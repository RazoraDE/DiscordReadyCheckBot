Invitation-Link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=753270895560359967&permissions=207936&scope=bot

**Commands:**  

**!Ready Start** - Starts a new ready check  
**!Ready Who** - Shows who is ready  

**Latest change:**  
• A ready check can now get called in multiple channels.  
• Added customized messages for state pick.  

**Notes**  
• **!Ready Who** only works if the origin check is within the **latest 50 messages!**  
• If the channel-category matches a server-role, users automatically get mentioned by the bot.  

**Bugs**  
• Users are able to select multiple states.  
• Don't write "*Starting a ready check for*". Just don't. Much Error.
